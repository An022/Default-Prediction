# Default-Prediction
## Predict if a customer will default in the future

This GitHub repository contains a project report on how data analytics can help banks manage credit risks and address the increasing credit card default rate. The report evaluates the variables in forecasting credit default using Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost algorithms. The results show that LightGBM and XGBoost have higher accuracy and area under the curve. The project was developed using the Kaggle platform, and the available data was provided by American Express Credit Card Service. The authors express their gratitude to the data science and machine learning community for sharing brilliant ideas and to their professor and assistant for their insightful comments and guidance during the project.
